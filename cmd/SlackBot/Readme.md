## Building

1. Create two Bot accounts on slack
2. Note the API keys and usernames
3. Create a slack team and channel
4. In both the server and client, update the channel name, admin user ID, and tokens where appropriate
5. Run `go build` for both the client and server
6. start the server with the appropriate arguments

Only tested build on win10 so ymmv

In the works: Making this all stageless
